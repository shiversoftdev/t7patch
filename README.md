Please do not try to use any public cheats with this patch. Almost all of them are incompatible.
# Instructions

1. Download [the patch](https://github.com/shiversoftdev/t7patch/releases/tag/Current).
2. Watch the [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/jDQkNV5J4SM?t=394). Read the FAQ for additional info before asking questions.
3. If not playing in matchmaking, set a network password to enable the best protection. Note that anyone who wants to play with you needs to have the same network password. If you want to play in normal matchmaking again, clear the network password.

# Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I need to run the patch if I am playing solo offline?
A: Simple answer, no. Technical answer, maybe. If you are high profile, run it regardless because steam networking is complicated.
### Q: Does this fix the RCE vulnerabilities you mentioned in your video?
A: Yes. This fixes 2 of the known RCE vulnerabilities. To my knowledge, there is at least one more and I am actively looking for it.
### Q: Do I need a VPN?
A: If you are high profile or a streamer, yes. Otherwise, not likely. If you are getting hit offline (internet) often, run a VPN.
### Q: Do I need an alternate steam profile? My stats don't transfer over!
A: Steam alts are only recommended for high profile players or streamers. If you are not being attacked, you don't need an alt.
Your stats will not transfer to your new account, and if you wish to retain stats you may need to resort to third party tools.
### Q: Does this patch work on Steam deck? Mac OS? Linux?
A: No. This patch is only designed to work on PC (Windows computers). I do not have plans to support other platforms at this time.
### Q: Does this patch fix the FPS issue?
A: Yes. There is a small subset of users who experience an additional frame rate drop at the start of matches, but this issue will be addressed when possible.
### Q: Can you make this patch compatible with other mod menus, cheats, or third party tools?
A: No. The patch uses a lot of complicated techniques to patch the game that interfere with most third party tools. This is due to the fact that Black Ops III is heavily resistant to patching by non-official sources. Additionally, I consider it a bonus that cheaters must choose to play unprotected to the griefing mechanisms that they have used against the community for so long.
### Q: Will you ever post source code?
A: Eventually. The patch is closed source right now because it fixes some major exploits which could very negatively affect the servers and unpatched users. When these exploits become widely known, I have no problem releasing source to the public.
### Q: Why does my anti-virus say this is malware?
A: The code is protected against reverse engineering. This protection unintentionally prevents anti-virus scans from identifying whether the tool is safe or not. Modern anti-virus will, by default, label anything that it cannot scan completely as malware to protect users.
### Q: What is the LPC file for?
A: The LPC file is to fix the A.B.C error on sign in. Not necessary for most users.
### Q: Who should I send crash reports to?
A: serious#9999 on discord. You must be in my server and allow dms from server members to message me. I will not accept friend requests.
### Q: Is this tool still updated?
A: Yes. I have been collecting information and working on a new version. 1.06 is expected to be pushed within a week or two.
